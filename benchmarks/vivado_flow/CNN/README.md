# Using RapidShell to Map Your Design

## What is `RapidShell`?


To facilitate rapid stream optimization, we use RapidShell as a framework to generate two IP-Integration Vivado projects. One project, named shell, includes only the essential elements for data communication across the FPGA fabric, CPU host, and High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM). The custom logic consists of an empty Verilog instance that instantiates 32 256-bit AXI3 master buses connected to all the HBM AXI buses. It also includes an AXI4 slave bus and an AXI-Lite bus. Three independent clocks drive the XDMA clock domain logic, kernel clock domain logic, and HBM clock domain logic.

We will create another IPI project for the custom logic which will instantiate all the user kernels generated by HLS or manual design. AXI-full slave bus will go through a asynchronous crossbar to
access of the HBM axi buses, therefore it can access all the 8GB high-bandwidth memory. The other 31 axi3 buses of HBM can be utilized by the axi master buses from all the kernels according to requirements. Axi-lite slave bus will go through a crossbar to drive the control axi-lite buses of all the kernels to control all the kernels such as configuring address offset, starting the kernel or stopping the kernels.
