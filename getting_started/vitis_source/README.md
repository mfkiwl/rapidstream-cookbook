AMD Vitis Design
================

In this recipe, we demonstrate how to optimize a simple vector addition design in a Vitis object file (`.xo`), and use its output object file to continue the Vitis development flow.

Xilinx Object Files
-------------------

[Vitis compiled object files (`.xo`)](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/Design-Topology) are IP packages used in the AMD Vitis kernel development flow for programming the programmable logic (PL) region of target devices.

These files can be [generated from HLS C++ code](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/Developing-PL-Kernels-using-C) using the `v++` command, [packed from RTL code](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/RTL-Kernel-Development-Flow), or created using third-party frameworks like [TAPA](https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/tapa). In this example, we use TAPA to generate the `VecAdd.xo` file in the `design` directory, but the same flow applies to object files generated through other methods.

RapidStream for Vitis
---------------------

The RapidStream flow for Vitis requires four key inputs:

1. **Device**: Specify the Vitis platform name for `v++`.
2. **Xilinx Object file** (.xo): Provide the file generated by `v++` or Vivado.
3. **Connectivity** (.ini): Include the configuration file for `v++`.
4. **Clock targets**: Define the desired clock frequencies.
5. RapidStream automatically handles all other aspects of the flow.

To execute the flow and generate optimized `.xo` files, run `rapidstream run.py` using the input from the `design` folder.

Outputs
-------

The RapidStream flow conducts design space exploration and generates optimized `.xo` files. You can locate these files using the following command:

```bash
find ./build -name *.xo
```

To examine the timing results for each design point, use this command:

```bash
find ./build -name *.xclbin.info
```
